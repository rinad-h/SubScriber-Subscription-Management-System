# SubScriber: Subscription Management System

## Project Overview
SubScriber is a simple subscription management system designed to help individuals manage their personal and household subscriptions. This project allows users to easily add, view, update, and remove subscriptions while ensuring data integrity and preventing errors like negative costs or duplicate subscription names.

## Background
In my ENTI 201 class (Introduction to Business Venturing), we were tasked with developing a business idea that could solve a real-life problem or "bug" we face in our everyday lives. During this assignment, I realized that managing multiple subscriptions—whether it's for streaming services, fitness plans, or other recurring services—was becoming a hassle. The issue of losing track of payments, forgetting to cancel services, or even just trying to remember which subscriptions I have was something I wanted to solve.

I wanted to create a solution that would help users manage their subscriptions in an efficient way, keeping track of subscription names and costs, as well as enabling users to add, view, update, and remove subscriptions as needed. The goal of SubScriber is to simplify the process of managing multiple subscriptions, ensuring users stay organized and avoid unnecessary charges.

## Features
- **Add Subscription**: Allows users to add a new subscription with a name and cost.
- **View Subscriptions**: Displays all current subscriptions in a readable format.
- **Update Subscription**: Provides functionality to modify the name and cost of an existing subscription.
- **Remove Subscription**: Allows users to delete a subscription by specifying its index.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures that subscriptions have unique names and that costs cannot be negative.

## Technologies Used
- **C programming language**: The program was developed using C, utilizing basic data structures, functions, and file I/O for handling user interaction.
- **Standard Libraries**: The project uses standard C libraries for handling input/output and string manipulation.
