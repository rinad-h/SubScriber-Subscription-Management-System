Assumptions Made

1. The maximum number of subscriptions a user can have is 100
2. The maximum lenght for the subscription name is 50 chars
3. The program does not save user data (e.g., subscriptions, costs, etc.) after the program ends or the terminal is closed. 
   All user inputs are stored temporarily during the session, and once the program is exited, the data is lost. For data 
   persistence across sessions, additional features like file storage or database integration would need to be implemented.
4. List of subscriptions will be displayed in the order they were added
5. Each subscription has a unique name and cost
6. Cost is a float
